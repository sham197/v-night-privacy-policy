    <h1>Privacy Policy — V-Night: Reboot</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>25.09.2025</strong></p>

    <p>Dreamfinity ("we", "us", "our") operates the mobile game <strong>V-Night: Reboot</strong> ("the Game"). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat information in connection with your use of the Game. This policy is written in plain English and intended for global users.</p>

    <h2>1. Summary</h2>
    <p>Short version: <strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII)</strong> from players. The Game does not require account creation, email addresses, or any personal data to function.</p>

    <h2>2. What we do NOT collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, usernames, or nicknames linked to real persons;</li>
      <li>Email addresses or phone numbers;</li>
      <li>Precise geolocation (GPS) or coarse location data;</li>
      <li>Contact lists, photos, files, or other user files;</li>
      <li>Device identifiers tied to a person (we do not collect Advertising IDs or other PII);</li>
      <li>Any data that would qualify as personal data under GDPR, CCPA, or similar laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-party services and SDKs</h2>
    <p>We currently <strong>do not use</strong> third-party analytics, advertising networks, or crash-reporting services in the Game. The Game is built with Godot Engine 4 and uses a <code>gradle</code> build process for packaging only. We do not embed libraries that collect or transmit user data.</p>
    <p>If in future we add third-party services (for example analytics or ads), we will update this Privacy Policy to list those services and link to their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Children</h2>
    <p>The Game is intended for users aged <strong>13+</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect or store personal data, the risk of data breach related to personal data is minimal. Nevertheless, we follow common-sense practices for secure code and distribution:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not transmit personal user data from the Game;</li>
      <li>We sign releases and distribution packages as appropriate; keep build tools up to date;</li>
      <li>If any service that stores data is added in the future, we will describe security measures in an updated policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes (for example, we begin to collect personal data or integrate third-party analytics/ads), we will post the revised policy at this same URL and update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the Game after such updates constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:dreamfinitycoop@gmail.com">dreamfinitycoop@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>This policy is provided on an international basis. Where local legal requirements apply (for example GDPR for EU users or CCPA for California residents), we will comply with the applicable legal obligations. For legal notices, Dreamfinity operates internationally; the developer contact is above.</p>
